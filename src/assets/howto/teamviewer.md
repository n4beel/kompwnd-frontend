# Team Viewer

The [Team Viewer](/teamviewer) is a great tool to see how your team is growing and earning in one place.

You can view not only your team, but any Kompwnd user's team by entering their Alacrity Username into the username field and clicking View Team.

By default, the Team Viewer will show a simplified Team Structure View this allows you to quickly see who your downline Team Members are:

You can toggle the Show Deposits slider

to retrieve your team members deposits. Now the Team Viewer will display your team alongside their current deposit state.
Rewards are not displayed here since they are calculated when a Kompwnd user rolls or claims their dividends.
