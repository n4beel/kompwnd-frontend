# Airdrops

Airdrops allow you to reward your Kompwnd Team with KPW.

## Airdrop Input Fields

### Team

The `Team` field is any Kompwnd user's username that you wish to supply the Airdrop to, this could be set to yourself or another Kompwnd user.

If the team is yourself, you are not available to earn your own Airdrop Rewards.

### Campaign

There are 6 different `Campaign` types through the Kompwnd UI:

* Divide Between All matching players
* Award one Winner ( picks randomly among any matching players )
* Divide across 5 matching players
* Divide across 20 matching players
* Divide across 50 matching players
* Divide across 100 matching players

If the selected Kompwnd Team doesn't have enough matching players to satisfy dividing between 5, 20, 50 or 100 players The airdrop defaults to divide between All matching players.

### Minimum Directs

The `Minimum Directs` is a Airdrop Campaign filter that requires matching players to meet the input value of minimum direct buddies.

This user would qualify for a Minimum directs of `3`, but not a minimum directs of `4`. Even though his team comprises of `4` Kompwnd Team members only `3` are his direct buddies.

### Team Depth

You can limit how far your Airdrop Campaign will search for matching players with the `Team Depth` input `default: 0` at `0`. Team depth is unlimited depth where `2` would stop searching for matching players after your direct lines buddies.

### Minimum Net Deposit (KPW)

You can set a minimum Deposit requirement with the `Minimum Net Deposit` input field. This will require all applicable players to meet this minimum Deposit requirement.

### Budget

Finally the budget is how much you want to Award the Kompwnd Team you have selected. As stated before, this reward will be handled how you set your `Campaign` input.

## Running Your Campaign

In order to execute the Airdrop Campaign you must first do a test run. This will help you not make mistakes and see all matching players that could win rewards. Running a test will not show you who wins since the winner can only be chosen by the math provided by Alacrity Block Producers. 

For a Kompwnd User to win, they must meet all of your Campaign settings and have an active Kompwnd Deposit running.
